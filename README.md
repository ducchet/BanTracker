# BanTracker
A simple discord bot that tracks bans on Hypixel using their API

## Usage
Open config.json and insert your API Key(s), bot token, and the channel ID of the channel you want the bans to be logged in.

Example:
``` json
{
    "API-Keys": [
        "API-KEY1",
        "API-KEY2"
    ],
    "Token": "BOT-TOKEN",
    "Channel": 1234567890
}
```

The code in this repository is not my best work, it is rushed and terrible. Do not judge my coding ability off of this.
